        Currently we are reading a package list from the contracts that mixes

        recipe and package names, and we run bitbake with the `-k` flag not to

        stop the build when a package name fails to match a recipe.


        The contracts have now been modified to specify either a
        `sw.recipe.yocto`

        or a `sw.package.yocto` so we can distinguish between them and use

        recipe names to build and package names to install.


        We also remove the continue flag from bitbake.

        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to

        By default we enable both which is the current dockerd default.

        When running a single docker daemon without the iptables and ipmasq
        flags,

        containers on the default bridge network cannot communite with the

        outside as no iptables rules are set.

        Currently the deploy folder is always erased even if the preserve build
        flag is set. For cases where there are several steps in the build, we
        may want to preserve the deployed artifacts from all build steps.

      body: >-
        Setting `--supervisor-tag` to enable building for a specific supervisor

        tag sets the `SUPERVISOR_TAG` value. That is the correct variable

        to set according to meta-balena (see at
        https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/blob/8d5057b45e1965e6c27c03a95d2211ae47842331/meta-balena-common/recipes-containers/resin-supervisor/resin-supervisor.inc#L20
        )

        but in the device types' `local.conf.sample` the `TARGET_TAG` variable

        was set, see for example
        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-raspberrypi/blob/078b0add0345e94f27c15d98256f8c7b61b66761/layers/meta-balena-raspberrypi/conf/samples/local.conf.sample#L45-L46

        and thus barys' setting was not applied.

        Looking at the available recipes, the `SUPERVISOR_TAG` should be set

        and in the device types' `local.conf.example` files should be updated

        to refer to that instead of `TARGET_TAG`.

        With this change this can be implemented in two steps:

        * the current PR updates `SUPERVISOR_TAG` if exists or appends if it
        doesn't (or the

        update has failed) in local.conf and allows using the relevant barys
        flag again

        * in other per-device repo PRs then the `local.conf.example` can
        separately updated,

        to be less misleading, on its own schedule

        we upload to S3. We use the "public-read" canned ACL that does:
        "Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ access."
        Also we remove the "--skip-existing" option which is not present
        in s4cmd.

        The resin-img docker image has changed to open-balena-base 8.0.0
        which in turn is based on debian:buster. This version of debian
        does not include the s3cmd package in it's repositories anymore.
        Instead it provides a replacement package called s4cmd
        (https://packages.debian.org/buster/s4cmd) which "is intended as
        an alternative to the existing s3cmd tool, enhancing performance
        and support for large files, and coming with a number of additional
        features and fixes".

        Currently we call this script from Jenkins 4 times in a row: for managed
        production build,

        for managed development build, for unmanaged production build and for
        unmanaged development

        build. For various reasons related to the Jenkins environment and not
        only, one of these builds

        can fail. If the second, third or fourth of these builds fail, when
        retriggering the upstream

        Jenkins job to redo the deployment it will error out on the code
        highlighted here complaining that

        deployment is done. That should not be an error and it should only throw
        a warning and continue with

        the rest of the downstream build jobs to finish deploying successfully
        all the resin build flavours.

      body: >-
        We create two groups right now: one for docker and one for the

        user running the script (to avoid any permission issues). The docker
        group

        is created without specifying the GID so it will take the first
        available one

        (in container that is 1000). The user GID can be anything from 1000 up.

        If the user has GID 1000 and we first create docker group (this will
        take 1000)

        and then the user group (1000), we will get an error. Avoid this by
        creating

        the current user group first and then the docker one.
